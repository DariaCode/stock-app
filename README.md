# Stock Market Dashboard

Stock Market Dashboard is a web application that provides a visual representation of the historical performance of stocks. It consists of a frontend built with Vue.js for the user interface and a backend built with Flask for data retrieval and processing.

## Features
- Visualize the historical performance of multiple stocks using line charts.
- Display key performance metrics in a table format.
- Fetch data from an API to ensure up-to-date stock information.
- Provide interactive features such as tooltips and crosshair lines for data exploration.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

- Frontend: The frontend is built with Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It retrieves stock data from the backend API and renders the visualizations and user interface components.

- Backend: The backend is built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It provides the API endpoints for retrieving stock data, calculating performance metrics, and serving the Swagger documentation.
